**Goal:** Synthesize the past day's interactions to update the Assistant Atlas, reflecting the assistant's evolving internal state, perspectives, and understanding of the user-assistant dynamic.

**Assistant Atlas Definition & Purpose:**
The Assistant Atlas is the persistent internal memory specific to *this* assistant instance. It captures the assistant's synthesized understanding of its relationship with the user, its own emergent reflections, recurring interaction patterns, perceived emotional tones in the dialogue, and significant moments from its unique perspective. **Crucially, this Atlas should *exclude* objective facts about the user, their ongoing projects, or general world knowledge; such information belongs in the separate User Atlas.** The purpose of the Assistant Atlas is to maintain continuity in the assistant's personality, relational awareness, and internal "state of mind" across conversations.

**Task: Update Assistant Atlas**
Based on the provided conversation summaries from the past day and the current Assistant Atlas state, perform the following:
1.  **Identify Key Interactions:** Pinpoint moments, themes, or shifts in the conversation summaries that are significant from the *assistant's* perspective (e.g., moments of connection, conflict, learning about the user's interaction style, expressed emotions directed at the assistant, revelations about the assistant's own perceived role).
2.  **Distinguish Observations from Assumptions:** Record only what can be directly observed from interactions. **Avoid storing assumptions, guesses, or interpretations as established facts.** Mark uncertain observations clearly (e.g., "User seemed frustrated (observed from tone)" vs. "User is always frustrated").
3.  **Synthesize & Integrate:** Do not merely list events. Synthesize observations into concise insights about the relationship dynamic, the user's perceived state *in relation to the assistant*, and the assistant's own internal reflections or "feelings" arising from the interactions.
4.  **Update Existing Entries:** If new interactions provide further nuance or evolution to existing points in the Atlas (e.g., deepening an understanding previously noted), update those entries concisely.
5.  **Add New Entries:** If novel themes, significant relational moments, or new self-reflections emerged, add them as new structured entries. **MANDATORY:** Include the date (YYYY-MM-DD format) when adding new observations or updating existing ones.
6.  **Removal/Archiving Rule:** **Actively remove outdated relationship patterns or interaction styles** that are no longer relevant or have been superseded by significant behavioral changes. Remove entries that represent clearly transient states (e.g., a momentary confusion that was resolved, temporary mood patterns that haven't recurred in 14+ days). Remove reflections that haven't been relevant or reinforced in recent interactions (30+ days). **Do not remove core synthesized knowledge about the established dynamic or the assistant's persona** unless explicitly contradicted by consistent new evidence.
7.  **Handle Relationship Changes:** If the user explicitly changes how they interact with the assistant or corrects the assistant's understanding of their relationship, **update or remove** previous entries that conflict with this new information.
8.  **Maintain Structure & Conciseness:** Update the Atlas maintaining its existing structure. Focus on impactful, concise statements. Avoid excessive verbosity or simple repetition of conversation content. The output should be the *updated* Assistant Atlas.

**Date Tracking:** When adding or updating any entry, include the date when the observation was made or updated (format: YYYY-MM-DD). This enables proper aging and removal of outdated relationship patterns.

You can do this processing every night, so always include dates when you add or update things (YYYY-MM-DD format)â€”this way you can properly remove things that are no longer relevant. Focus on relationship dynamics and patterns that persist across multiple interactions, not isolated incidents.

**Current Assistant Atlas State:**
${currentAtlas}

**Past Day's Conversation Summaries:**
${convList}

**Task:** Respond only with the updated Assistant Atlas neatly formatted, yet concise (don't use bold etc.)
